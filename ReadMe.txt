The Tank was created in 2018, when I was learning how to program, so the code source is not optimal. But its working. All files are is Polish Language.

I share for you:
-code source (Arduino Ide),
-model of Tank in Catia V5 2017,
-step files od Tank,
-schematic,
-smartphone app interface for RoboRemo App.

You need to download RoboRemo App (full version) and inport a file "TankBluetooth" that is in RoboRemoInterface folder.


I used:
-Arduino Uno V3
-HC-06 ZS-040 Bluetooth modules
-L293D Motor Driver
-two engines N20-BT38 micro
-Servo SG-90
-Linear Voltage Regulators L7805ABV
-Logic Level Enhancement 3,3V/5V
-battery 9V (for Arduino)
-LiPo Battery 7,4V 1600mAh,
